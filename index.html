            <p class="paragraphe">Boxxler is a puzzle game where you control a character tasked with moving boxes to goal points. The objective is to complete each level using the fewest moves possible. You can move your character in four directions to push the boxes, but watch out for walls that can block your path. Think strategically before making a move, as a wrong choice can lead you into a dead end. Complete all the levels to become a Boxxler master!</p>
